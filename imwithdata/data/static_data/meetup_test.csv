As of spring 2017, it's been enacted into law in 11 states, so we are more than halfway there!</p> <p>The National Popular Vote is fundamental; it’s about the structure—the bones—of our democracy and impacts all of our other goals because they likely will find a much more conducive federal environment under a President elected by the majority of citizens.</p> <p>BIPARTISAN: The current National Popular Vote effort began in 2005 and is not about the 2016 election or partisan politics in general but about replacing the outdated and problematic ""winner-take-all"" election scheme, which divides the country into ""battleground"" and ""spectator"" (or ""fly-by"") states and makes only the votes in the battlegrounds politically relevant.</p> <p>In addition, presidential candidates have no incentive to pay attention to the issues of concern to voters in states where the statewide outcome is a foregone conclusion--or to direct financial resources there before and after the election.</p> <p>WHY NOW: If enough of us support the bill during the remaining states' current legislative sessions, it has a very real chance of being in place by 2020.</p> <p>ASK YOURSELF: Am I ready to directly decide who leads the country? Am I ready to make every vote count?</p> <p>OCTOBER 7 FUN: Yes, lots of great performers, speakers, and celebrities--and most importantly YOU. What could be more empowering and exciting than helping the country take a giant leap forward? Bring your friends and kids; wear something special or meaningful; show your support for the National Popular Vote or different forward-thinking cause; and join other respectful, peaceful marchers ready to make history.</p> <p>For more info on the march AND the National Popular Vote as such, please join the following Facebook page and also share the Facebook link with family, friends, and other groups to HELP SPREAD THE WORD:</p> <p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/natlpopvotemarchdc/""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/natlpopvotemarchdc/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/natlpopvotemarchdc/</a></a></p> <p><br/><i>Exact locations TBD closer to date.

And there are MANY others who are in the initial planning stages around our country and the world.</p> <p>For those who can not attend the March in DC, we URGE all our community members, their families, friends, and allies to reach out to their local Pride organizations to help coordinate additional solidarity marches. Use these organizations to help bring your local communities together. The issues that face our community are not just national, but local as well. In short time, we will start linking all the pop-up solidarity marches to this main event page, as well as a web page that will be created with more information on all the marches.</p> <p>Let’s make this truly a “National Pride March” that spreads from coast to coast and shows solidarity through our Pride movement. Although at the pace we are going, we might have to change the name to the ""Global Pride March!"" Finally...we want to keep building off the mometum and follow the leadership that Black Lives Matter and the Women's March have created in this new era of activism.</p> ",28800000.0,0,2017-02-03 22:30:04,22222617,open,41.83000183105469,-71.41000366210938,#Resist: Providence,Resist-Providence,Members,,238274494,https://www.meetup.com/Resist-Providence/events/238274494/,0.0,National Pride March,,upcoming,2017-06-11 09:00:00,2017-03-08 15:03:37,-14400000,TBD,Washington,us,25096994.0,38.90278625488281,USA,-77.0022964477539,TBD,,False,DC,,public,0,5,meetup

Recent policy changes have caused heightened worry among scientists, and the incredible and immediate outpouring of support has made clear that these concerns are also shared by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Mischaracterization of science as a partisan issue, which has given policymakers permission to reject overwhelming evidence, is a critical and urgent matter.

We come from all races, all religions, all gender identities, all sexual orientations, all socioeconomic backgrounds, all political perspectives, and all nationalities. Our diversity is our greatest strength: a wealth of opinions, perspectives, and ideas is critical for the scientific process. What unites us is a love of science, and an insatiable curiosity. We all recognize that science is everywhere and affects everyone.</p> <p>Science is often an arduous process, but it is also thrilling. A universal human curiosity and dogged persistence is the greatest hope for the future. This movement cannot and will not end with a march. Our plans for policy change and community outreach will start with marches worldwide and a teach-in at the National Mall, but it is imperative that we continue to celebrate and defend science at all levels - from local schools to federal agencies - throughout the world.</p> ",25200000.0,0,2017-02-03 22:32:49,22222740,open,38.630001068115234,-76.87000274658203,#Resist: Waldorf,Resist-Waldorf,Members,,237521907,https://www.meetup.com/Resist-Waldorf/events/237521907/,0.0,March for Science,,upcoming,2017-04-22 09:00:00,2017-02-07 08:07:02,-14400000,"900 Ohio drive, SW",Washington,us,1296874.0,38.88151931762695,USA,-77.03262329101562,National Mall,202.426.6841,False,DC,20242,public,0,12,meetup

The day’s program will include speeches and trainings with scientists and civic organizers, musical performances, and a march through the streets of Washington, D.C. The crowd will gather at 8:00am, and the teach-in will begin at 10:00am.</p> <p>This Earth Day, join the effort to defend the vital public service role science plays in our communities and our world.</p> <p>Science serves all of us.</p> <p>It protects our air and water, preserves our planet, saves lives with medical treatments, creates new industries, puts food on our tables, educates the next generation, and safeguards our future.</p> <p>Science isn’t Democratic or Republican, liberal or conservative. Indeed, threats to science are pervasive throughout governments around the world.</p> <p>Using the teach-in concept deployed for the very first Earth Day in 1970, the rally and teach-in on the National Mall will focus on the need to hold our leaders – both in science and in politics – accountable to the highest standards of honesty, fairness, and integrity. The vital role science plays in our democracy must be preserved.</p> <p>ABOUT MARCH FOR SCIENCE:</p> <p>The March for Science is a celebration of our passion for science and the many ways science serves our communities and our world. The March for Science is an unprecedented global gathering of scientists and science enthusiasts joining together to acknowledge the vital role science plays in our lives and the need to respect and encourage research that gives us insight into the world.</p> <p>ABOUT EARTH DAY NETWORK:</p> <p>The first Earth Day on April 22, 1970 activated 20 million Americans from all walks of life and is widely credited with launching the modern environmental movement. Growing out of the first Earth Day, Earth Day Network works year-round with tens of thousands of partners in 192 countries to broaden, diversify and mobilize the environmental movement. More than 1 billion people now participate in Earth Day activities each year, making it the largest civic observance in the world.</p> <p>For information about satellite marches, please visit <a href=""https://www.marchforscience.com/satellite-marches/""><a href=""https://www.marchforscience.com/satellite-marches/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.marchforscience.com/satellite-marches/</a></a>)</p> ",32400000.0,0,2017-02-03 22:33:05,22222753,open,39.11000061035156,-77.23999786376953,#Resist: Gaithersburg,Resist-Gaithersburg,Members,,237967048,https://www.meetup.com/Resist-Gaithersburg/events/237967048/,,March for Science,,upcoming,2017-04-22 07:00:00,2017-02-24 15:28:24,-14400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,public,0,10,meetup

The day’s program will include speeches and trainings with scientists and civic organizers, musical performances, and a march through the streets of Washington, D.C. The crowd will gather at 8:00am, and the teach-in will begin at 10:00am.</p> <p>This Earth Day, join the effort to defend the vital public service role science plays in our communities and our world.</p> <p>Science serves all of us.</p> <p>It protects our air and water, preserves our planet, saves lives with medical treatments, creates new industries, puts food on our tables, educates the next generation, and safeguards our future.</p> <p>Science isn’t Democratic or Republican, liberal or conservative. Indeed, threats to science are pervasive throughout governments around the world.</p> <p>Using the teach-in concept deployed for the very first Earth Day in 1970, the rally and teach-in on the National Mall will focus on the need to hold our leaders – both in science and in politics – accountable to the highest standards of honesty, fairness, and integrity. The vital role science plays in our democracy must be preserved.</p> <p>ABOUT MARCH FOR SCIENCE:</p> <p>The March for Science is a celebration of our passion for science and the many ways science serves our communities and our world. The March for Science is an unprecedented global gathering of scientists and science enthusiasts joining together to acknowledge the vital role science plays in our lives and the need to respect and encourage research that gives us insight into the world.</p> <p>ABOUT EARTH DAY NETWORK:</p> <p>The first Earth Day on April 22, 1970 activated 20 million Americans from all walks of life and is widely credited with launching the modern environmental movement. Growing out of the first Earth Day, Earth Day Network works year-round with tens of thousands of partners in 192 countries to broaden, diversify and mobilize the environmental movement. More than 1 billion people now participate in Earth Day activities each year, making it the largest civic observance in the world.</p> <p>For information about satellite marches, please visit <a href=""https://www.marchforscience.com/satellite-marches/""><a href=""https://www.marchforscience.com/satellite-marches/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.marchforscience.com/satellite-marches/</a></a>)</p> ",32400000.0,0,2017-02-03 22:32:51,22222741,open,39.099998474121094,-76.87999725341797,#Resist: Laurel,Resist-Laurel,Members,,237989484,https://www.meetup.com/Resist-Laurel/events/237989484/,,March for Science,,upcoming,2017-04-22 07:00:00,2017-02-25 17:19:57,-14400000,,,,,,,,,,,,,public,0,5,meetup
