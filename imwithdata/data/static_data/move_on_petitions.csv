        Legislation must be passed to limit the amount of our taxpayer money spent on the Trump family's golf trips, vacations, and business trips—and on future presidents' expenses.

        No one elected Ivanka Trump.

        It is unjust to cut PBS, NEA, Meals on Wheels, heat assistance, etc., while the taxpayers pay 3.3 MILLION (16.5 MILLION so far) for Trump to play golf in FL. We want a Bill that sets a cap on government spending for Presidential vacations and non-essential trips, based on past Presidential outlays. Everything over that cap will be the responsibility of the President.        ",TAXPAYER Revolt against Trump Golf Trips!,http://petitions.moveon.org//sign/taxpayer-revolt-on-trump?source=homepage

        We, the undersigned, strongly urge you to reject President Trump’s proposed federal budget for 2018. Trump’s budget would mean deep cuts to the agencies that protect our health and safety, our workplaces and wallets, and our environment and economy. It would decimate critical public services and protections while perpetuating tens of billions in corporate welfare and subsidies.

        Donald Trump's proposed tax plan will cost $6 trillion, money that is desperately needed to rebuild our economy by investing in infrastructure, green-jobs, education, medical research and so much more.

        Trump wants to slash funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and put even more American families in harm’s way for the sake of corporate profits.

A vote to cut the EPA’s funding is a vote for more lead poisoning crises like we saw in Flint, Michigan. It’s a vote for more cancer-causing pesticides contaminating our food and water. And it’s a vote to make people sick.

        As Brietbart News has emerged from the sewer of hatred to become the home of White Nationalism, many national companies have taken steps to pull their advertising dollars. 

Not so with Nissan. 

Even worse, Nissan has chosen to intimidate Mississippi workers (the majority of whom are Black) against voting for a union, even though the company is union everywhere else in the world. 

Nissan needs to decide what side of history they will stand on.  And as a first step,  stop advertising with Breitbart.        ",Nissan finances racist Breitbart propaganda,http://petitions.moveon.org//sign/nissan-finances-racist?source=homepage

        We the people demand an independent investigation into the death of Darren Rainey, a mentally ill inmate at Dade Correctional Institution.  The Miami-Dade Medical Examiner's autopsy report concluded that Rainey died from complications of schizophrenia, heart disease and confinement in the shower.  This autopsy—completed three years after Rainey's death—does not fault the people who put Rainey in the hot shower and kept him there for hours.  This is an illogical and unacceptable conclusion.
